# PacMen-Exercise
A simple game with our lovely PacMan. Tireless PacMan will walk the field. You can start/stop the game. You can click the Up/Down button to make it go up or down.

## Future Improvement
The game can be made much more fun!
- Make PacMan move following mouse move event
- Add sound when PacMan bounces off an edge
- Add random balls bouncing and PacMan has to catch them; time the duration for PacMan to catch all of the balls. The score can be recorded and a leader board can be displayed. Etc, etc.
